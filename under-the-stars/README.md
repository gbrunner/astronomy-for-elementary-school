# Under the Stars

This lesson is what we will discuss for our first time observing.

## Our Observing Location
We will be pbserving out in Wentzville, MO at the [St. Charles County Astronomy Viewing Area](https://www.sccmo.org/1915/Astronomy-Viewing-Area).

From their webpage: *With its remote setting and limited light pollution, [Broemmelsiek Park](https://www.sccmo.org/617/Broemmelsiek-Park) offers a wonderful opportunity to view the night skies. Open around the clock, the park's unique astronomy viewing area has 10 concrete viewing stations equipped with electrical service to accommodate the latest telescopes. The site is open on a first-come, first-served basis and serves as the primary location for fun weekly stargazing opportunities.*
